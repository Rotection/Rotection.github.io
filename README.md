# Rotection

Community-driven Roblox game safety rating system  
Focused on honesty, fairness, and protecting players.

## What is Rotection?

Rotection is a project designed to help players check if a Roblox game
is safe, respectful, and age-appropriate — rated by the community.

It does **not** judge gameplay quality.  
It only evaluates safety & fairness.

## How Ratings Work

1. Players submit a rating through the Rotection Discord forum
2. They must follow a strict template
3. Rotection parses the post and verifies structure
4. Scores get calculated and added to the website
5. Mods only step in to remove spam or jokes  
   *no manual approval for every rating*

## Rating Categories (1–5 scale)

- Honesty  
- Safety  
- Fairness  
- Age Appropriateness  

> Ratings convert into a **% safety score** out of 100.

## Automation Goals

- ✅ Community submissions  
- ✅ Game data object format  
- 🔜 Discord AI post-reader  
- 🔜 Automatic rating extraction  
- 🔜 Auto import game thumbnail  
- 🔜 Verified developer badge system  

## Why This Exists

Roblox has millions of games.  
Not all are safe for everyone.

Rotection gives parents & kids a **simple trust system** without judgment,  
just facts and scores from users.

## Development Status

- Front-end: in progress
- Discord rating system: prototyping
- AI parsing: planned
- Database: planned deployment

## Note to Contributors

Please keep code clean, organized, and scalable.  
Follow the vision: **fair, transparent, community-powered safety**.
